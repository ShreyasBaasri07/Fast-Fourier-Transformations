# Fast-Fourier-Transformations<br>
Project aimed at finding the product of polynomials in more efficent way rather than the brute force approach.<br>
Fast Fourier Transform helps us in calculating the product of polynomials in O(nlogn) by evaluating the polynomials at complex roots of unity.<br>
Intermediate results which were complex numbers were encrypted and decrypted using RSA methodology.<br>
Finally image compressions were carried out using these fast fourier transformations.<br>
