# Fast-Fourier-Transformations
Project aimed at finding the product of polynomials in more efficent way rather than the brute force approach.
Fast Fourier Transform helps us in calculating the product of polynomials in O(nlogn) by evaluating the polynomials at complex roots of unity.
Intermediate results which were complex numbers were encrypted and decrypted using RSA methodology.
Finally image compressions were carried out using these fast fourier transformations.
